# E-Mail-Spam-Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect email spam. By analyzing email content and metadata, the model will classify incoming messages as either spam or legitimate. Features such as keywords, sender reputation, and email formatting will be used to train the model and improve its accuracy.
